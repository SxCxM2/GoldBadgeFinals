CHALLENGE 1: CAFE;



										The Menu Items:
. A meal number, so customers can say "I'll have the #5"
. A meal name
. A description
. A list of ingredients,
. A price
 

Your Task:
1. Create a Menu Class with properties, constructors, and fields.
2. Create a MenuRepository Class that has methods needed.
3. Create a Test Class for your repository methods. (You don't need to test your constructors or objects, just your methods)
4. Create a Program file that allows the cafe manager to add, delete, and see all items in the menu list.
 

Notes:
We don't need to be able to update items right now.
